BUSINESS PLAN

** NEED TO GET FocusGroup query selector updates pulled out and put into a module. It makes document.querySelectorAll faster. **

still need frames because otherwise we cannot keep the runner running when the page changes.

Testing Memory:
    if you open the same page in IE, FF, Safari... and Chrome; and than navigate to about:memory in Chrome, it will report memory usage across all other browsers. Neat!

Marketing Model
    - Free account will not store date online for test results.
    - Paid accounts will store for various amounts of time. Maybe a 30 day max? Or an option to save a result to file to compare for later.
    http://simperium.com/pricing/ - sockets. pricing is awesome.
    http://trackjs.com/blog/better-way-track-javascript-errors/ - a cool design.
    keep results for last 1 for free and larger number of results of tests for paid accounts. They always get the result real time, but it is only saved if they paying up to X amount.
        - always store at least the last result to prevent some tests from needing to re-run needlessly.

TODO:
* NEED to have our ui run in a frame.
    * and an need to have that change urls and pick up from same spot in test.

    (W!) Location href change. ***** NEED PROOF OF CONCEPT ASAP ******
        * need to be able to skipToStep(#) so that on page change the runner can jump to that step and continue.
        [----------------- AFTER COMPLETE, this needs moved to a new project. ---------------------]

    (R/W) Layout design for user interface.
        - We need to design the user interface so that it gives an awesome user experience. Time should be taken to plan
            this carefully.
        - check boxes to enable or disable tests.
        - collapsible rows.
        - Actions so that certain steps can be repeated (like logging in).
        - add assertions wherever.

    (R) Analytics:
        - Needs to be implemented with "TRACK THIS" option. So anyone can create analytics.
        - Analytics needs to be it's own tab in the UI.

    (W/R) End to end test with the user driving and it showing to your page.
        (LiveTest) goinstant.com live recording.
        record and playback.

    (R) schema matching. Before or after they may want the data to match a schema. Rob's schema matching.

    - Live chat with analytics - see goinstant.com widget at bottom right with question mark.
        (called intercom)

    (W) Performance steps could be in a column and based on an average of how log each of their child steps took.
        - this way the chunks that go up if too many steps are slow slows it down. Performance score of all tests should be at the top.
        (R) Performance Analytics
            - performance results should be kept so that they can show the improvement or digression over time.
        - Number of child steps for each node should be listed in a column. Those steps should count down or show x of y for each scene/scenario.
            - this would allow the progress to show on each test.
        - Custom threshold: This would allow the user to place what time any scenario, scene, or step, must complete in. If omitted or 0, the default
            threshold is determined by the number of child steps and the average per step as listed above.
        - PAID: make option to see how it performs under X number of users all doing the same thing at the same time.

    (?) When starting to record they must enter a scenario and then scenes. Should these be renamed? (marathon, sprint, step...)
        - They cannot just record, they need at least a scenario and a scene.
        * This will not work for customers and recording their steps. A default scenario will need to be created with the user info.
            steps may need to be able to attach directly to a scenario, or a default scenario created for auto record scenarios.

    (W) Visual Test list:
        - Need to gather the initial data of all steps so that they can see progress as it moves through them.
        - This should then be able to list the estimated time to complete all of the tests and progress bar.

    (W) Try/Catch needs to be enabled so that it will automatically pause or stop on an exception.
        - Try to provide as much information about the error as possible. Including stack trace if possible.

    (W) Events
        - runnerEvent: These are the events for the steps that are fired from the runner so that the UI can display them.
        - browserEvent: These are only listened to in recording mode. So that the events can be recorded and put together into a e2e test.
            - MouseMovement: http://paperjs.org/examples/path-simplification/ - awesome framework for recording the mouse movements.
                - need to auto implement hover states for elements that the mouse is over.

    (W/R) Mock Service Responses:
        - A way to capture and fake the service responses. So that a scenario can be run over and over without the data changing.
            this would need to be optional so that they can re-record or just run against live services.
            - This would also allow tests to run faster if they are using mock responses, mock responses need to be able to delay
                or be instant.

    (W) icons: needs to show timeout icons, paused icons, error, running, success, notRunYet. These show in front of the label so they are obvious.
        - performance is not here. That has it's own column. Possibly something a free account doesn't get.

    (W/R) need to be able to have a proxy that they can request their services through so they can be recorded. All playback is on cached services.
        - need to keep track of how long the service took to make it consistent with the app.
        - simulate timing on the server for how long the service should take.

    (W) if a selection (find) fails then QA can have the option presented to just replace the selection and pick a new one. OR keep up to this point and copy to a new test.

    PHASE 1. Macros.

    Admin to export the xml file to be able to run it again.

    Make timestamps only do performance. Make so increments actually determine complete fail and the amount of steps.

COMPETITORS:
    http://speedcurve.com/ - page load speeds. uses Google Page Speed (https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/). (Nice colors)


STRUCTURE:
    scenario: A full set of steps that can be selected to run from the main menu. This is the only scope for which a test can be run because it can have variables.
    series: A reusable set of steps. It can also be used as a macro.
    set: Sets a value on a scenario. Even if inside a series it goes to the scenario.

PROBLEMS:
    Shadow Dom. (Polimer Objects) (Can we simulate a click with the capture event and offset of the x,y on the item)
                [5/14/14, 5:28:10 PM] Robert Taylor: ok, talked with monty, he said it is possible to inspect the shadow DOM but didn't know the javascript function, he said it is something like element.shadowRoot.query(....) but we will need to find out and test it
                [5/14/14, 5:28:28 PM] Robert Taylor: also in looking found some other links for reference...

                [5/14/14, 5:34:15 PM] Robert Taylor: its dart? not sure if works in JS
    Canvas - Need to be able to select and build selectors.
    SVG - it is dom. We should be able to build a selector.
