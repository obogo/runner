# ux-runner.js #
----------


Need to make the following apps for runner.
Editor
    - when on that page and wanting to add steps, automatically (start recording)
    - when wanting to tweak steps directly in code.
    - editor may run in hide mode or maybe auto record mode that allows you to record a user on the site without display.
    - View Analytics.

Viewer
    - Allow you to see the process running on multiple browsers and the results of those realtime.
    - You cannot tweak tests from here. You can only run them and view their results.
    - View analytics.

These could be the same app, just different pages.
