record in and out ajax.
save them to our server.
- admin to allow them to change statuses
- they can also create urls as well by hand.
    - need to keep a list of each one and the response. not the params sent, but the response to each # of that call. call 2 gets response 2.


Could have prebuilt mocks like interfacing with twitter and so on.
- these would be free because they are not custom data.
